                            <p>Cloud Computing has become the buzzing topic of today's technology, driving mainly by marketing and services offered by prominent corporate organizations like Google, IBM & Amazon. Cloud computing is the next stage to evolve the Internet. 
                                Though for some people, "Cloud Computing" is a big deal, it is not. In reality, cloud computing is something that we have been using for a long time; it is the internet facility, along with the associated standards that provide a set of web-services to users. 
                                When users draw the term 'Internet' as a "cloud", they represent the essential characteristics of cloud computing.</p>

                            <h6>DEFINING CLOUD COMPUTING</h6>
                            <p>Cloud computing is the latest generation technology with an extensive IT infrastructure that provides us a means by which we can use and utilize the applications as utilities via the Internet. 
                                Cloud computing makes IT infrastructure along with its services available "on-need" basis. The cloud technology includes - a development platform, hard disk, computing power, software application, 
                                and database. This technology doesn't require large-scale capital expenditure to access cloud vendors. Instead, the cloud facilitates 'pay-per-use,' i.e., the organizations' users have to pay only that limited  
                                amount to use the cloud infrastructure. In other words, cloud computing refers to applications and services that run on a distributed network using virtualized resources and uses the standard internet protocols for accessing.</p><br>
                            <h6>AFFECT OF CLOUD ON HUMAN VALUES</h6>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The application became cheaper, easier to find, and use.</li>
                                <li>New application becomes more comfortable to develop & create based on a standard modular part.</li> 
                                <li>Cloud will provide new social services by connecting through social networks.</li>
                                <li>Lessen the usage of proprietary operating systems in our daily computing.</li>
                                <li>Connection to the cloud can be made whenever we want.</li>
                            </ol><br>
                            <h6>PREREQUISITES TO CLOUD</h6>
                            <p>Before learning about Cloud technology, readers must know about Networking, computers, database, etc. Terms such as operating system, applications, programs, 
                                and their meanings must be known before starting this.</p><br>
                            <h6>WHY THIS CLOUD TECHNOLOGY?</h6>
                            <p>The small and extensive IT companies follow the old traditions of managing IT infrastructure, i.e., server room, to keep all the details and maintain that server. In a word, it is a server room consists 
                                of database servers, mail server, firewalls, routers, switches, QPS (Query per second) & Load handler, and other networking devices along with server engineers. To provide such IT infrastructure, 
                                a huge amount of money has to spend. So, to reduce the IT infrastructure cost, Cloud Computing technology came into play.</p><br>
                            <h6>ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD</h6>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Low Cost: To run cloud technology, users don't require high power computers and technology because the application will run on the cloud and not on users' PC.</li>
                                <li>Storage capacity: The Cloud storage capacity is unlimited & generally offers a vast storage capacity of 2000-3000 GBs or more based on the requirement.</li>
                                <li>Low cost of IT infrastructure: As discussed earlier, the investment will be less if an organization uses Cloud technology; even the IT staffs and server engineers are also not required.</li>
                                <li>Increase computing power: Cloud servers have a very high-capacity for running and processing tasks and the processing of applications.</li>
                                <li>Reduce Software Costs: Cloud minimizes the software costs as users don't need to purchase software for organizations or every computer.</li>
                                <li>Updating: Instant software update is possible & users don't have to face the choice problem between obsolete & high-upgrade software.</li>
                            </ol><br>
                            <h6>THE LATEST PARADIGM</h6>
                            <p>
                                Cloud computing technology brings a shift in the real paradigm of technology in the way systems are deployed. 
                                The massive cloud computing technology was enabled by the likeness & trend of the Internet & the growth of some 
                                famous multinational companies. Cloud computing makes the user dream come into reality by the concepts of 
                                'pay-as-you-go', infinite scale architecture,and universal system available with high-speed and accuracy.

                                With the cloud's help, an organization or individual can start from low and small grade to a big name within a  
                                short time. So cloud computing is said to be a revolutionary change, even though the technology is still in an 
                                evolving stage. Cloud computing takes services, applications, and technology similar to the internet world and 
                                converts them into a self-service utility.
                            </p>
                            <h6>DISADVANTAGES OF CLOUD</h6>
                            <ol>
                                <li>nternet speed: Cloud technology requires a high-speed internet connection as web-based applications often require a large bandwidth amount.
                                    </li>
                                <li>Constant Internet Connection: It's impossible to use cloud infrastructure without the Internet. To access any application or cloud storage, a constant internet connection is required.
                                   </li>
                                <li> Security: Data storage might not be secure. With cloud computing, all the data gets stored in the cloud & hence the unauthorized user may gain access to the user's data in the cloud.</li>
                            </ol><br>
                            <h6>CLOUD MODEL TYPES</h6>
                            <p>If we analyze the Cloud technology intelligently, we will see that most people separate the cloud computing model into two distinct sets:

                                1.Deployment Model: refers to the management of the cloud's infrastructure. The cloud hosting deployment model designates the cloud environment's exact category, its size, and the accessing mechanism. It also tells the nature and purpose of the cloud.
                                2.Service model: Cloud computing is a broad term that holds a more extensive range of services. It is composed of a particular type of service; a cloud computing platform allows its users to access.
                                These topics will have an elaborate discussion on the later chapters as each of them has their subcategories.</p><br>

                                Let us assume that you are the CEO of an organization, and you have a big organization. Naturally, it becomes your duty to ensure that all employees of your organization have adequate hardware and 
                                software to carry on their tasks. Now, it is not possible to buy software and application for every computer and every employee. As the hiring of an employee continues, the buying of licensed products is also mandatory.  So you have to spend a lot on each employee.
                                
                                But there is an alternative concept you can execute for a better result. Instead of buying and installing software for each PC, load a single application that will allow the employee to log-in to a web-based
                                 resource that hosts all the users' programs based on the requirement. Everything will run by another company's remote servers and facilitates us by providing everything from word-processing applications to spreadsheets, database applications, email, and data analysis programs. This technology is called "cloud computing," which brings a revolutionary change in the IT industry.</p>
                            <h6>HISTORY OF CLOUD</h6>
                            <p>In the early era of technology, client-server architecture was popular with mainframe and terminal applications. At that time, storing data in CPU was very expensive, and hence the mainframe connected 
                                both types of resources and served them to a small client-terminal. With the revolution in the mass storage capacity, the file servers gained popularity for storing vast amounts of information.
                                
                                In 1990, the giant connecting concept - the Internet, finally got enough computers attached to it. The connection of those machines together creates a massive, interconnected shared pool of storage
                                 that won't be possible for a single organization or institution to afford. There comes the concept of "grid". The term 'grid' has a misinterpretation as a synonym for 'cloud computing' as both of the technology is formed from many computers connected. 'Grid Computing' requires the usage of application programs to divide one large system processing to several thousands of machines. But there lies the disadvantage; 
                                that if a single part of a software node fails the processing or working, other pieces of that software nodes may also fail to process. So, this 'grid'-based working concept didn't become so fruitful.
                                
                                On the other hand, cloud computing involves the concept of 'grid', except that it provides on-demand resource provisioning.
                                On the first milestone of cloud technology, Salesforce.com engraved its name in 1999. It pioneered the technique of delivering enterprise applications via a simple website. They provided both specialist & mainstream software firms to bring up used over the internet.
                                
                                The next development was in 2002 by Amazon's Web Service (AWS). They provided cloud-oriented services, including storage, computing power & human intelligence via Amazon Mechanical Turk. In 2006, Amazon launched their EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - a commercial web service that let small organizations and sole proprietors rent computers on which they run their computer applications.
                                
                                EC2/S3 became the 1st accessible cloud technology infrastructure service.
                                In 2009, another significant milestone engraved the name of Google with Web 2.0.  Google and others started to offer browser-based applications via Google apps and other apps. Then came Microsoft's Azure - both Microsoft and Google deliver services in a way that is reliable and easy to consume.</p>

                                The cloud has to be divided into different layers. These layers are the front-end and back-end layers. The Front-end layer is that part of the cloud with which users can interact with. 
                                For example, when we log in to our Gmail account, we see the UI (user interface) where everything works on event-driven buttons and graphics. Similarly, the software also runs in the front end of the cloud. Again, the back-end comprises hardware as well as software that delivers the back-end data from the database to the front end.
                                
                                Cloud uses a network layer to connect different devices to provide access to resources residing in the centralized data center of the cloud. 
                                Cloud technology users can use the data center through the company's network or internet facilities. This technology provides various advantages; users can access the cloud from anywhere at any time, but the network bandwidth should have to be more. This technology not only facilitates desktop and laptop users, but mobile users can also access their business systems based on their demand.
                                
                                As we already know that cloud computing is fast and efficient, applications running on the cloud take advantage of flexibility and computing power, i.e., the speed of processing a task. Many computers of a single organization work together along with their application on the cloud as if all the applications were running on a single machine. This flexibility of accessing the cloud resources allows users to use much or little of the resource based on the demand.
                                
                                In the Cloud computing system architecture, there is another mechanism of shifting the workload. Local machines don't have to perform massive lifting operations when it comes to run applications. Cloud technology can handle those heavy loaded tasks automatically, easily, and efficiently. This brings down the hardware & software demands. The only thing that the users have to think of is the system's cloud computing interface software, which works merely as a web-browser at the front end of the user. The cloud's network takes care of the rest along with the back-end.
                                
                                
                                The back-end is connected through a virtual network or internet. Other than that, there are few more components such as Middleware, cloud resources, etc. that include cloud computing architecture. The backend is used by service providers that include various servers, computers, virtual machines & data storage facilities combined to form the cloud technology. Its dedicated server handles each application in the system. The front end includes the cloud computing system or network used to access the cloud computing system. The cloud computing systems' interface varies from cloud to cloud.
                                The back-end has two principal responsibilities:
                                
                                1.Provides traffic control mechanisms, security postures & governing the protocols.
                                2.To employ those internet protocols that are connected to the networked computer for communication.
                                One central server is used to manage the entire cloud system architecture. The server is solely responsible for handling the smoothness of traffic without disruption. Middleware is a particular type of software that is used to perform processes & also connects networked computers. Depending on the client/user's demand, the storage is provided by the cloud technology's service provider.

                                Since cloud technology provides many benefits to users, these benefits should be classified based on the needs of the users. The cloud deployment model represents the exact category of cloud 
                                environment based on proprietorship, size, and access and also describes the nature and purpose of the cloud. Most organizations implement cloud infrastructure to minimize capital expenditure & regulate operating costs.

                                The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is an agency under the scope of the US Department of Commerce, which is responsible for expounding & defining standards in Science and Technology. The Computer Security Division of NISD has provided a formal definition of Cloud computing. The US government is a major consumer of computer technology and one of the major cloud computing network users. According to the NIST working definition of cloud, the deployment model is one of the two categories of the model illustrated by NIST. The NIST model doesn't require cloud technology to use virtualization to share resources. Cloud support multi-tenancy; multi-tenancy is the concept of sharing of resources among two or more clients. The latest NIST model of cloud computing requires virtualization and utilizes the concept of multi-tenancy.
                                
                                As cloud computing, we have to approach a set of interactive components, such as service-oriented architecture; users can expect that future versions of the NIST model may also include more features.

                            Public Cloud is a type of cloud hosting that easily allows the accessibility of systems & its services to its clients/users. Some examples of companies that provide public cloud facilities are 
                            IBM, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. This cloud service is open for use. This type of cloud computing is a true specimen of cloud hosting, where the service providers render services to various clients. 
                            From the technical point of view, there is the least difference between private clouds and public clouds along with the structural design. Only the security level depends based on the service providers and the type of cloud clients use. The public cloud is better suited for business purposes for managing the load. This type of cloud is economical due to the decrease in capital overheads.

                            The advantages of the public cloud are:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Flexible</li>
                                    <li>Reliable</li>

                                </ol>

                            This type also holds some disadvantages, such as:

                            1.Less Secured
                            2.Poor Customizable

                                Hybrid Cloud is another cloud computing type, which is integrated, i.e., it can be a combination of two or more cloud servers, i.e., private, public, or community combined as one architecture, but remain individual entities. Non-critical tasks such as development and test workloads can be done using the public cloud. In contrast, critical tasks that are sensitive such as organization data handling, are done using a private cloud. Benefits of both deployment models, as well as a community deployment model, are possible in a hybrid cloud hosting. It can cross isolation and overcome boundaries by the provider; hence, it cannot be categorized into any of the three deployments - public, private, or community cloud.

                                Advantages of Hybrid Cloud Computing are:
                                    <ol>

                                Community Cloud is another type of cloud computing in which the cloud setup is shared manually among different organizations that belong to the same community or area. An example of such a community is where organizations/firms are there, along with the financial institutions/banks.
                                A multi-tenant setup developed using cloud among different organizations that belong to a particular community or group having similar computing concerns.
                               
                               For joint business organizations, ventures, research organizations, and tenders, a community cloud is an appropriate solution. The selection of the right type of cloud hosting is essential in this case. Thus, community-based cloud users need to know and analyze the business demand first.

                            <p>SaaS is defined as the software distribution model deployed on the internet in which a cloud service provider provides applications. It is also known as "on-demand software" or "pay-as-you-go application". \
                                Here the customer licenses their product via SaaS-providers. SaaS market is a rapid-growing one, and with this fast-growing service, SaaS will soon become an active cloud service technology for every organization and company. So it's important to understand those users and or buyers the usage of SaaS and why it is suitable.
                                </p>
                            <p>In SaaS, the software & the applications associated with it are centrally located on the cloud server. Users can access them via a thin client connecting application, i.e., using a web browser.</p>
                            <p>The SaaS provides various applications such as:
                            </p>
                            <ol>

                            </ol>
                            <p>There are various advantages and disadvantages of SaaS. The advantages are:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Easy to buy: SaaS's cost is based on monthly or yearly fees allowing new organizations to access the world of business at a low-cost, at least lesser than licensed application.</li>
                                <li>Minimization of Hardware Requirement: All SaaS software is hosted remotely & so there is no or lesser need for hardware for the organizations.</li>
                                <li>Special Software: No special software versions are required, as all the users will use the same software version. SaaS reduces IT costs by outsourcing hardware & software maintenance.</li>
                                <li>Low Maintenance: SaaS removes the daily problem of installing, maintaining, and updating software. The set-up cost of SaaS is also less in comparison to enterprise software.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Disadvantages are also the points that users and vendors must keep in mind while using the SaaS:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Latency factor: comes due to a variable distance of data between the cloud & the end-user, and hence a possibility of latency may arise while interacting with applications.</li>
                                <li>Internet Connection: is a major issue. Without an internet connection, SaaS applications are unusable.</li>
                                <li>Switching between SaaS vendors in case of any change is very difficult.</li>
                                <li>The SaaS cloud service is not very secure as in-house deployment.
                                </li>

                            <p>PaaS is a platform for programming developers and brings benefits - SaaS is used for but from the software development point. It is the computer platform that provides the facility to use web applications quickly. With ease, without buying & maintaining web-development, PaaS has a similarity with that SaaS except that SaaS delivers software over the web. In contrast, PaaS provides a platform for the creating of software delivered over the web. PaaS has a feature of a point-and-click tool that allows non-programmers to develop web applications. App-Engine of Google & Force.com, Windows Azure, AppFog, Openshift, and VMware Cloud Foundry are PaaS examples. </p>
